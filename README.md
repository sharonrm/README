# MENT
 
The Ment App redesigns what it means to be a Mentor. As soon as a user registers or logs in, they are shown a list of topics that other people are struggling with. Users can post comments on a topic, scheduling a time to meet up and mentor the user with their particular question. If the user has a topic they need help in, they can post it up and anticipate a response from a trusted and friendly mentor.

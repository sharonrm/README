# GOSU
 
GOSU is a ruby gem used for 2D game development. It's a library for Ruby and C++. It's mainly used to teach or learn Ruby.
GOSU provides:  

* A game window
* 2D graphics and text
* Sound in various formats
* Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input


## Installation Instructions: ##
You need to first have Ruby installed and then install the following:

*  brew install sdl2 (you may or may not need this first step, you can first try to just install the gem)
*  gem install gosu


Then create a new file:

```require 'gosu'

class MyWindow < Gosu::Window
  def initialize
    super 640, 480
    self.caption = 'Hello World!'
  end
end

window = MyWindow.new
window.show
```

This class will provide all the basic functionality for creating a game including the window, timing intervals, the show method which creates a modal application where the window is receiving calls to update, show in addition to many other methods.
